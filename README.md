# ⚡ AC Phasor Analyser

A Python-based GUI tool for analysing AC circuits. Enter your circuit parameters and instantly get phasor diagrams, impedance calculations, phase angles, and voltage/current magnitudes — all in one window.

---

## 📸 Features

- 🔢 **Input AC circuit parameters** — Voltage, Current, Resistance, Inductance, Capacitance (RLC), Frequency, and Phase angles
- 📊 **Phasor Diagram** — Visual plot of voltage and current phasors
- 🧮 **Impedance Calculations** — Calculates total impedance (Z) of the circuit
- 📐 **Phase Angle Results** — Shows the phase difference between voltage and current
- 📈 **Voltage & Current Magnitudes** — Displays calculated magnitudes clearly
- 🖥️ **Easy-to-use GUI** — Built with Python, no command line needed

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** — for the GUI window
- **Matplotlib** — for phasor diagrams and plots
- **NumPy** — for numerical calculations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Install the required libraries by running this in your terminal:

```
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

### Running the App

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/umak21/ac_phasor-analyser.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
```
cd ac_phasor-analyser
```

3. Run the Python file:
```
python main.py
```
*(replace `main.py` with your actual filename if different)*
